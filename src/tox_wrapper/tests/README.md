These are the tests taken from <https://github.com/oxij/PyTox>
forked from https://github.com/aitjcize/PyTox by Wei-Ning Huang
<aitjcize@gmail.com>. They have been converted to work with ```toxygen```.

All of the dependencies on ```toxygen``` should have been removed,
but if you copy this directory to a subdirectory of ```toxygen/toxygen```
then the tests may expand to testing some features of ```toxygen``` as well.
The tests are good examples of how to run Tox in Python.

You can run the tests by running ```tests_socks.py```.

```

Look at the ```@unittest``` decorators in the code for tests that
are known to fail, or are unfinished. They will be skipped, but should
all be eventually fixed and made to work. It has been tested with UDP and
TCP proxy (Tor), and with Tor **you may have transient errors** due to
connectivity - simply rerun with a sacrificed goat entrails on the keyboard.

It has ***not*** been tested on Windows, and there may be some minor breakage,
which should be easy to fix.

Currently:
```
Ran 34 tests in 86.589s
OK (skipped=12)
